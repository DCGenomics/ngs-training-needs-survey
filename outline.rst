Genome assembly and annotation:

* Assembling and annotating bacterial and archaeal genomes (w/Illumina, PacBio)

* Assembling and annotating non-plant/animal eukaryotic genomes (w/Illumina)

* Assembling animal genomes (w/Illumina)

* Annotating animal genomes

* Assembling plant genomes (w/Illumina)

* Annotating plant genomes

* Annotating bacterial genomes

* Emerging technologies for genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation in plants

* Emerging technologies for genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation in bacteria and archaea

* Emerging technologies for genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation in animals

Resequencing and variant calling:

* Variant calling on bacterial and archaeal genomes

* Variant calling on plant and animal genomes

* Genotyping by sequencing

Transcriptomics:

* mRNAseq expression analysis in major model organisms (human, mouse, zebrafish, Arabidopsis, yeast, worm, Drosophila)

* ab initio transcriptome assembly, annotation, and expression analysis (semi-model animals and plants)

* de novo transcriptome assembly, annotation, and expression analysis (non-model animals and plants)

* Reference-genome-based bacterial and archaeal transcriptomics

* De novo mRNAseq in bacteria and archaea (no reference genome)

Metagenomics and microbial ecology:

* Amplicon analysis of populations and population structure

* Reference-based metagenomics (e.g. human microbiome)

* De novo shotgun metagenome and metatranscriptome assembly and analysis

Other:

* ChIP-seq analysis

* Reduced representation analysis of genomes and populations

* Marker development
