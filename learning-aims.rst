Learning Aims
=============

(Long term goals `of training <http://ngs-training-needs-survey.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__.)

The workshops will, in the long term, enable students to:

* Be capable of doing their own data analysis.

* Be future proofed against new software.  Students will be able to
  pick up new version of existing software, or new software, and apply
  them to their data.

* Know how to assess computational performance and design appropriate
  computational controls.

* Record their analysis workflow, publish reproducible analyses, and
  track data provenance manually.

* Use the appropriate statistical models and tools.

* Gain in efficiency and expertise on their own, or via informal interactions
  in person, online, and through reading.

* Choose and apply the appropriate computational resources.
