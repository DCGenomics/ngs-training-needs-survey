Tiers of training
=================

There are a lot of necessary skills for doing `data intensive biology
<http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-the-emerging-field-of-data-intensive-biology.html>`__.  How do you teach them all, and in what order?

Here's a set of tiers of training for an intro class or course in
next-gen sequence analysis; feedback welcome!

My teaching philosophy is to try to motivate later topics by first
introducing the concepts in a useful workflow, and then diving deeper
into the topics once they've been motivated.  So the approach is to
start with the minimum necessary to get something done, and then explain
it in more detail after the first pass.

Interpreting this diagram
-------------------------

Except for the second tier, completion of all of the topics in one
tier would be necessary to move on to the next.  For the second tier,
completion of at least one topic would be needed to move on to the next
tier.
